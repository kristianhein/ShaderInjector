# Configuration Guide

#### NOTE: 2.2.0+

Starting with 2.2.0, while most of this guide is still applicable, there is now an in-menu UI called Shader Configuration, which parses many of the wired up pre-processor macros in the HLSL shaders. Allowing users to easily find/search and adjust parameters in-game without needing to tab out of the game, edit shader files, then tab back in to recompile shaders.

*NOTE: This was written at the release of 2.0, with newer updates this might become more out of date but the general principles are the same.*

With the release of 2.0 it comes with a whole suite of new shaders and features that drastically improve the lighting quality of the game! **However...**

**Some of the features and effects that are featured in screenshots or videos that you might have seen are disabled by default.** This is done for various reasons, the main one being performance. Some of these effects are still experimental and are quite heavy at the moment, I have done my best to optimize but to go further will require further updates in the future to make them much lighter to run. In addition some of them may have some visual problems. For instance the SSGI can add a lot of noise to the final image, or the Auto Exposure can flicker quite a bit.

With that said, even in my sessions I find most of the issues managable and performance on my system *(RTX 3080)* at native 1080p is acceptable. If you want the full visual splendor I will guide you on where to enable the features!

***As a final note for this section, [all shaders can be edited live](https://github.com/frostbone25/ShaderInjector/blob/main/LiveShaderEditing.md). You do not need to close or relaunch the game any time you make a change.***

# Maximum Visual Quality Configuration

By default as of 2.0 SSGI and it's AO counterpart along with auto exposure are disabled. In 2.1 they are also disabled by default in the performance preset *(but not the maximum quality)*. To match the visual fidelity as seen in promotional screenshots and videos heres how to enable them.

### SSGI / AO

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\ComputeShaderPass_ReflectionEnvironment.hlsl
```

Open this file in a text/code editor and you'll find the following fields...

```GLSL
//#define SSGI_AMBIENT_OCCLUSION

//#define SSGI_BOUNCE_LIGHT
```

To enable them, just simply get rid of the two forward slashes on each of them like so...

```GLSL
#define SSGI_AMBIENT_OCCLUSION

#define SSGI_BOUNCE_LIGHT
```

***NOTE: If you don't like the noise introduced by ```SSGI_BOUNCE_LIGHT``` you can leave it disabled and just enable ```SSGI_AMBIENT_OCCLUSION``` to get the massively improved occlusion.***

Save changes to the file and tab or open the game back up, and click ```Recompile All```.

![recompile-all](GithubContent/LiveShaderEditing/recompile-all.png)

You should see immediate visual changes after compilation completes, with more visible ambient occlusion and local bounce light from direct lighting sources!

If you do not be sure to check for compilation errors in the runtime logs at the bottom of the ShaderInjector window. If there are that means you have created an error due to improper syntax by not following instructions or you accidentally added/removed a character that the compiler can't resolve. So undo your changes until the shader can compile again, by default all shaders can compile successfully.

*NOTE: Some of these effects are known to be noisy. This will be improved in future updates as currently I cannot introduce dedicated filtering passes, [but here is the section that you can follow to reduce the noise contribution from those effects.](#noise-reduction)*

### Auto Exposure

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\PixelShaderPass_PostProcessFinal.hlsl
```

Open this file in a text/code editor and you'll find the following fields...

```GLSL
//#define AUTO_EXPOSURE
```

To enable them, just simply get rid of the two forward slashes on each of them like so...

```GLSL
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE
```

Save changes to the file and tab or open the game back up, and click ```Recompile All```.

![recompile-all](GithubContent/LiveShaderEditing/recompile-all.png)

You should see immediate visual changes after compilation completes, with shadowed areas becoming brighter, and brighter areas becoming darker for an overall more consistent exposure.

If you do not be sure to check for compilation errors in the runtime logs at the bottom of the ShaderInjector window. If there are that means you have created an error due to improper syntax by not following instructions or you accidentally added/removed a character that the compiler can't resolve. So undo your changes until the shader can compile again, by default all shaders can compile successfully.

#### Auto Exposure Notes

The metering was rewritten. It is now measured once per wave instead of once per pixel, and it reads the glare (bloom) chain, which is already a downsampled and blurred copy of the scene. That means every metering sample is an area average rather than a single point, which is what removes most of the flicker: point samples of the raw framebuffer land on different scene content every time the camera moves, averaged samples do not.

**This reduces the flicker, it does not eliminate it.** You may still see some in certain conditions. If it bothers you, lowering `AUTO_EXPOSURE_STRENGTH` is the first thing to try, and tightening the rejection window below can help with sudden jumps.

**Brightness changes are still instantaneous.** There is no adaptation over time yet, because that needs state that survives between frames and the injector cannot provide that today.

If you want to trade some responsiveness for extra stability, lower the strength:
```GLSL
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_STRENGTH 0.5
```

You can also change the sample count. The samples are shared across the wave rather than repeated per pixel, which is where the speedup comes from, but the cost still scales with how many you ask for.

Measured in game on a 4070 Ti at 1440p native, TAA, no upscaling, camera locked in photo mode. Cost of the metering itself, taking `AUTO_EXPOSURE` disabled as the zero point:

| `AUTO_EXPOSURE_SAMPLE_COUNT` | metering cost |
|---|---|
| 16 | 0.05 ms |
| 128 | 0.19 ms |
| **256 (default)** | **0.34 ms** |
| 512 | 0.66 ms |
| *old 16x16 per-pixel grid* | *1.39 ms* |

That works out at 0.00122 ms per sample plus about 0.03 ms of fixed cost, and it stays linear across the whole range, so there is no cliff to fall off. If you are short on frametime, dropping to 128 saves you 0.15 ms. If you want more stability, leave `AUTO_EXPOSURE_SOURCE_GLARE` on rather than raising this: area averaged samples buy far more stability per unit of cost, and nothing above 256 has been shown to look any steadier.
```GLSL
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_SAMPLE_COUNT 256
```

```AUTO_EXPOSURE_CENTER_FOCUS``` controls how much the middle of the screen counts towards the average. **Note that the meaning of this setting changed.** It used to shrink the sampled region, so at 0.5 the exposure was only ever looking at the middle quarter of the image and anything bright wandering through the center swung the exposure hard. It is now a weight: the samples always cover the whole screen, they just count for more towards the middle. 0.0 weights everything equally, 1.0 weights the center heavily.
```GLSL
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_CENTER_FOCUS 0.5
```

Bright outliers like the sun, speculars and spell effects are the main cause of sudden exposure jumps, so samples that sit far from the average get clamped before being counted. Widen these if the exposure feels too unresponsive to genuinely bright or dark areas, tighten them if it still jumps.
```GLSL
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_REJECT_LOW_EV 3.0
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_REJECT_HIGH_EV 2.0
```

If the image comes out consistently too dark or too bright once auto exposure is on, adjust the glare calibration. The glare chain sits at roughly 1/15th of scene brightness and this converts it back, so lower it to darken and raise it to brighten.
```GLSL
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_GLARE_CALIBRATION_EV 3.9
```

If the game's bloom is ever unavailable, you can meter the raw scene color instead. This is less stable, since it loses the area averaging.
```GLSL
//#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_SOURCE_GLARE
```

Lastly you can still disable the effect entirely.
```GLSL
//#define AUTO_EXPOSURE
```

The other note is that you can also control the maximum ranges at which the auto exposure can brighten or darken the final image. In areas of brightness, ```AUTO_EXPOSURE_MIN_EV``` controls how far the auto exposure can darken the image in order to retain a consistent exposure. In areas of darkness ```AUTO_EXPOSURE_MAX_EV``` controls how far the auto exposure can brighten the image in order to retain a consistent exposure.
```GLSL
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_MIN_EV          -6.0
#define AUTO_EXPOSURE_MAX_EV           1.0
```

*NOTE: ```AUTO_EXPOSURE_GRID_X``` and ```AUTO_EXPOSURE_GRID_Y``` no longer exist, they were replaced by ```AUTO_EXPOSURE_SAMPLE_COUNT```. If you had saved values for them in the Shader Configuration UI they will simply be dropped.*

### Tonemapping

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\PixelShaderPass_PostProcessFinal.hlsl
```

Open this file in a text/code editor and you'll find the following fields...

```GLSL
#define TONEMAP_PRESERVE_COLOR_GRADE

//#define TONEMAP_NONE
//#define TONEMAP_GRAN_TURISMO_7
//#define TONEMAP_AGX
//#define TONEMAP_UCHIMURA
//#define TONEMAP_REINHARD
//#define TONEMAP_REINHARD2
//#define TONEMAP_UNCHARTED2
//#define TONEMAP_ACES
//#define TONEMAP_ACES_FITTED
//#define TONEMAP_FILMIC
//#define TONEMAP_UNREAL_3
//#define TONEMAP_KHRONOS_NEUTRAL
//#define TONEMAP_LOTTES
//#define TONEMAP_EXPONENTIAL
//#define TONEMAP_EXPONENTIAL_SQUARED
//#define TONEMAP_MGSV
//#define TONEMAP_TONY_MC_MAP_FACE
```

There are many different tonemappers to choose from. You can experiment but the ones I use in my videos/screenshots that is a personal favorite of mine *(and in my opinon the superior one out of all of them)* I use ```TONEMAP_GRAN_TURISMO_7```.

```GLSL
#define TONEMAP_PRESERVE_COLOR_GRADE

//#define TONEMAP_NONE
#define TONEMAP_GRAN_TURISMO_7
//#define TONEMAP_AGX
//#define TONEMAP_UCHIMURA
//#define TONEMAP_REINHARD
//#define TONEMAP_REINHARD2
//#define TONEMAP_UNCHARTED2
//#define TONEMAP_ACES
//#define TONEMAP_ACES_FITTED
//#define TONEMAP_FILMIC
//#define TONEMAP_UNREAL_3
//#define TONEMAP_KHRONOS_NEUTRAL
//#define TONEMAP_LOTTES
//#define TONEMAP_EXPONENTIAL
//#define TONEMAP_EXPONENTIAL_SQUARED
//#define TONEMAP_MGSV
//#define TONEMAP_TONY_MC_MAP_FACE
```

Save changes to the file and tab or open the game back up, and click ```Recompile All```.

![recompile-all](GithubContent/LiveShaderEditing/recompile-all.png)

You should see immediate visual changes after compilation completes, with different tonal range and better color accuracy than the base game! 

If you do not be sure to check for compilation errors in the runtime logs at the bottom of the ShaderInjector window. If there are that means you have created an error due to improper syntax by not following instructions or you accidentally added/removed a character that the compiler can't resolve. So undo your changes until the shader can compile again, by default all shaders can compile successfully.

### Bloom

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\PixelShaderPass_PostProcessFinal.hlsl
```

Open this file in a text/code editor and you'll find the following fields...

```GLSL
#define BLOOM_ENABLE

//#define BLOOM_PHYSICAL
#define BLOOM_PHYSICAL_INTENSITY 0.125

//#define BLOOM_ADDITIVE
#define BLOOM_ADDITIVE_INTENSITY 2
```

Bloom is enabled by default and is the original game behavior, however I have implemented an adjusted version that is more naturalistic which is ```BLOOM_PHYSICAL```. I prefer to use this one due to how natrual it makes the image.

```GLSL
#define BLOOM_ENABLE

#define BLOOM_PHYSICAL
#define BLOOM_PHYSICAL_INTENSITY 0.125

//#define BLOOM_ADDITIVE
#define BLOOM_ADDITIVE_INTENSITY 2
```

If you want to disable bloom entirely, just simply add two "//" before the line to disable.

```GLSL
//#define BLOOM_ENABLE
```

Save changes to the file and tab or open the game back up, and click ```Recompile All```.

![recompile-all](GithubContent/LiveShaderEditing/recompile-all.png)

You should see immediate visual changes after compilation completes, depending on the area you'll see bloom more prevelant. 

If you do not be sure to check for compilation errors in the runtime logs at the bottom of the ShaderInjector window. If there are that means you have created an error due to improper syntax by not following instructions or you accidentally added/removed a character that the compiler can't resolve. So undo your changes until the shader can compile again, by default all shaders can compile successfully.

# Other Configuration Notes

### Image Adjustments

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\PixelShaderPass_PostProcessFinal.hlsl
```

Open this file in a text/code editor and you'll find the following fields...

```GLSL
//default values
#define ADJUSTMENT_BRIGHTNESS_EV 0.0
#define ADJUSTMENT_CONTRAST 1.0
#define ADJUSTMENT_CONTRAST_PIVOT 0.18
#define ADJUSTMENT_SATURATION 1.0
#define ADJUSTMENT_VIBRANCE 0.0
#define ADJUSTMENT_TINT_COLOR float3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
#define ADJUSTMENT_TINT_FACTOR 0.0
#define ADJUSTMENT_GAMMA 1.0
#define ADJUSTMENT_LIFT float3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
#define ADJUSTMENT_GAIN float3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
```

If the image is too dark for you, or in some areas I would advise using these controls and changing the values to tune the image in a way that is acceptable to you.

Save changes to the file and tab or open the game back up, and click ```Recompile All```.

### Noise Reduction

Currently as of 2.0 there are some effects especially with the "maximum quality preset" that are enabled by default that in their current state are quite noisy unfortunately. The reason for this is due to limitations of the injector at the moment, and it's not possible to introduce new draw passes yet where these effects can be properly filtered/optimized. The only "denoising" that is happening is from the game's TAA/DLSS effects that are done later which actually work quite well to reduce the noise, but of course it's not enough. In the meantime there are solutions you can try to reduce the noise in the image but I will show in order of most to least what effects are currently contributing to this look that you can tweak.

#### SSGI_BOUNCE_LIGHT

This is the primary suspect that can introduce noise into the image.

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\ComputeShaderPass_ReflectionEnvironment.hlsl
```

Open this file in a text/code editor and you'll find the following fields...

```GLSL
#define SSGI_BOUNCE_LIGHT
```

Most of the noise at the moment will come from the SSGI_BOUNCE_LIGHT effect which tries to calculate localized bounce light from direct lights and emissive materials. For the most part this looks ok but it can rear it's ugly head in low lighting situations. Here's what you can do to reduce the noise...

- **Increase ```SSGI_RAY_COUNT```:** This has a direct impact to the quality of the noise *(more samples become more expensive quickly)*
- **Increase ```SSGI_RAYMARCHING_STEP_COUNT```:** This will improve the quality of the raymarch and reduce noise somewhat but of course at a big cost.
- **Increase Rendering Resolution:** This will make the impact of the SSGI signifcantly higher because it scales with screen resolution, but more pixels means the noise becomes smaller and the final result appears cleaner.
- **Update Game's DLSS Preset:** I have noticed while testing on multiple game versions that 1.0.0.5 seems to have an updated DLSS variant that actually led to reduced noise when SSGI was enabled. I would experiment with this as a potential avenue for improving the noise situation. **Presets L and K** reportedly have had the best results for resolving the noise much more cleanly.
- If none of the above satisfy you enough, you can just simply disable the effect.

#### SSR_ENABLE_ROUGHNESS

This is the second suspect that can introduce noise into the image. 

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\PixelShaderPass_SSR.hlsl
```

The SSR received some upgrades that made it higher quality and more physically based. It respect material roughness, and since the fallback cubemap reflections in the game are very inaccurate/sparse/low quality, I elected to also increase the coverage of the SSR. This is because SSR currently is the only effect currently that provides the most accurate/best quality reflection data whenever it's available. The downside with the upgrades done is that it can introduce noise into the image, so here's how you can reduce it.

- **Increase ```SSR_RAY_COUNT```:** This has a direct impact to the quality of the SSR and the reduction of noise. Higher values mean better quality but it can obviously become very expensive.
- **Increase Rendering Resolution:** This will make the impact of the SSR a little bit more expensive since it scales with screen resolution, but more pixels means the noise becomes smaller and the final result appears cleaner.
- **Update Game's DLSS Preset:** I have noticed while testing on multiple game versions that 1.0.0.5 seems to have an updated DLSS variant that actually led to reduced noise overall. I would experiment with this as a potential avenue for improving the noise situation. **Presets L and K** reportedly have had the best results for resolving the noise much more cleanly.
- If none of the above satisfy you enough, I will show you how you can revert the SSR to match the original game behavior which was *(mostly)* noiseless.

To revert the upgrades to SSR and return to original game behavior, within this shader...

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\PixelShaderPass_SSR.hlsl
```

Disable the following...

```GLSL
//enabled
#define SSR_ENABLE_ROUGHNESS

//disabled
//#define SSR_ENABLE_ROUGHNESS
```

Then within this shader...

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\ComputeShaderPass_ReflectionEnvironment.hlsl
```

You will find the following property...

```GLSL
//default
#define SSR_CONTRIBUTION_MULTIPLIER 100000.0

//original game
#define SSR_CONTRIBUTION_MULTIPLIER 1.0
```

Change the contribution value to 1.0 which is game defaults.

Those two changes will effectively revert the SSR into game defaults. This will mean that you will unfortunately lose out on the improved quality reflections but you will have far less noise from reflections.

*NOTE: In the future my plans are to replace the current stohastic screen space reflections with [screen space cone traced reflections](https://www.tobias-franke.eu/publications/hermanns14ssct/hermanns14ssct_poster.pdf). This will lead to dramatically reduced reflection noise, and overall improved quality/stability at the cost of BRDF accuracy, but it's good enough.*

#### SSGI_AMBIENT_OCCLUSION

This is the last suspect that can introduce noise into the image.

```
~FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\End\Binaries\Win64\ShaderInjector\ModifiedShaders\Includes\ComputeShaderPass_ReflectionEnvironment.hlsl
```

This is coming from the SSGI effect itself which has an ambient occlusion component. It's a much higher quality and more accurate ambient occlusion than the original game, and for the most part in my opinion this is still surprisingly clean and the noise is much less visible, but it's not entirely immune to it. It shares many of the infrastructure and parameters as the ```SSGI_BOUNCE_LIGHT``` so much of those still apply.

```GLSL
#define SSGI_AMBIENT_OCCLUSION
```

- **Increase ```SSGI_RAY_COUNT```:** This has a direct impact to the quality of the noise *(more samples become more expensive quickly)*
- **Increase ```SSGI_RAYMARCHING_STEP_COUNT```:** This will improve the quality of the raymarch and reduce noise somewhat but of course at a big cost.
- **Increase Rendering Resolution:** This will make the impact of the SSGI signifcantly higher because it scales with screen resolution, but more pixels means the noise becomes smaller and the final result appears cleaner.
- **Update Game's DLSS Preset:** I have noticed while testing on multiple game versions that 1.0.0.5 seems to have an updated DLSS variant that actually led to reduced noise when SSGI was enabled. I would experiment with this as a potential avenue for improving the noise situation. **Presets L and K** reportedly have had the best results for resolving the noise much more cleanly.
- If none of the above satisfy you enough, you can just simply disable the effect.
